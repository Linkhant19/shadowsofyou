I used to host my previous poem collections on my website on WordPress, but I wanted more creative freedom on how the aesthetics and tones of this collection is portrayed. For example, in each poem is a repo of their own and they are supposed to represent a flip book. As the reader reads through the flip book, the pages will get darker and darker like shadows consuming the story as it progresses. 

So, I watched a bunch of YouTube tutorials. I brainstormed the webpage design. I asked ChatGPT's help for minor fixes or questions about CSS references. I texted my Graphic Designer friend and asked her about how to make it mobile friendly. 

I do have some experience in web design, but the biggest challenge for me came from trying to make the website interface mobile-device-friendly. I have not done it before and I needed the website to adjust to mobile devices because I wanted people to be able to read the contents on their phones. There was a learning curve in setting the correct font sizes, adjusting the dimensions, rotating my flipbook animation, transforming the pages from horizontal to vertical, and more, but I am glad that I figured most of it out before the end of my spring break. 

<em>I have noticed that currently, the website is not functioning as expected on iPads, so I took note of that and I will be fixing that in the future. </em>

There are also some simple but subtle design decisions I made that you may notice. One of the examples is the background getting darker and darker as the pages are flipped. It is supposed to be a subtle indication of the shadows becoming more and more apparent and consuming the narrator as the story progresses. There are more references like this example that you may notice throughout my website. 

<h2><em>
What is Shadows of You? 
</em></h2>
<em>
On an ordinary day, on an ordinary night, you are walking through the same-old streets or lying in
your same old bed. Suddenly, you hear a piercing scream and they have appeared again. Shadows. You see them on
the strangers in the street. The white walls that you used to scribble your dreams on are now covered in horrid
silhouettes. Peter lost his shadow to fly away, but now you are falling again.

You wonder. If they left, then why do you still see shadows of them at 1 am on the walls in your
dimly lit bedroom? You see shadows under the spotlights of your past, your present, and your future, and you
begin to fear if this is a selfish decision to let these people who care about you into your life. All you are is
heavy-weight carrying every shadow of your past, and even though you try so hard to be as light as bright sunshine
for those you love, sooner or later, they will get introduced to the tears that come out at 2 am. Before you can
change, they have also become part of the shadows on the white walls. They have walked out of your door.
